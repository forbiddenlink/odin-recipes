            <h2>This is a very easy recipe made with simple basics you usually have 
                around the house. Perfect with after-dinner coffee or office pot-lucks. 
                My sons also like to top it with whipped cream or ice cream. Change it up 
                a bit by substituting a can of cherries or sliced peaches for a different 
                variety of cobbler.</h2>

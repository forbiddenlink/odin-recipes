        <h3>My family LOVES bread pudding, and this recipe is one that I have fine tuned 
            to their taste. I have to double this recipe, and bake it in a 9x13 inch pan 
            for my family! It's great for breakfast or dessert and is delicious with milk 
            poured on top! Enjoy!</h3>
